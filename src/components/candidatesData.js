        modalInfo: `Hello everyone, my name is Dhathruthv Baddam. Just yesterday, I was one of the 8000 incoming freshmen who came to the University of Cincinnati. Just yesterday, I was like every other college student juggling between classes and friends and classes. But just yesterday, I started to dream bigger than I ever had. That yesterday was three years ago, and here I am, today, running to be your best student body President.

        It was in my junior year of high school that I realized that life was
        getting too comfortable. A wise man once said 'where comfort begins, dreams die', and
        I had no plans of stopping being a dreamer so soon. And so, I made a decision to come to UC
        and set myself a challenge of living in a place completely alien to me, with people i've never met
        and more so going far away from the ones i've always loved and lived with.
        
        My journey at UC so far has at every helm proved my decision to come here right. A major part
        of my journey at UC has been the connections I've made with so many wonderful people and
        the desire to do my best and give them the college experience they deserve. And ever since
        began my Student Government journey, the journey to give every Bearcat the college they
        deserve.
        
        Through this campaign of ours and as the Student body President I want to help bring alive all the things that our students have always wanted to see at the University.
        
        And I have dared to dream again, to make a better UC for all of YOU, because every thought of our slate 'starts with you'!`,

        modalInfo: `As an incoming freshman to the University of Cincinnati, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The question that was consistently brought up was whether UC was the best place for me. After the fall semester of 2019, that question had been answered with a resounding yes! One thing that I’ll never forget was the idea that one of my good friends, Bansi Patel, always mentioned during our first year, which was that UC was a place where you get out of what you put into it. And that couldn’t be more true! During my freshman year, I experienced all that UC had to offer and am grateful for the opportunities the University has provided me.

        It’s these opportunities that give me the initiative to run for the Vice-Presidency of UC. During my time at UC Blue Ash, I’ve been able to run for and win the office of Vice-President and President respectively within the college, allowing me to develop as a leader and really understand what it takes to represent the people that I serve. It’s these two positions that have also provided me with growth opportunities for myself that I look forward to enacting as Vice-President of UC.
        
        With the pandemic continuously disrupting everything we’ve tried to do for the past two years, it’ll take great leadership to bring us back to the traditional college experience most students come to UC for. That’s where Dhathruthv and I come in. We not only believe in restoring the traditional experience at UC, but fundamentally changing the UC experience to make us a destination college. With free iPads for all and the first ever UC Fest headlining the It Starts With YOU platform, expect an sensational campus experience if we’re given the opportunity to be YOUR next President and Vice-President.`,

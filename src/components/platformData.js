        Day 1 - An International Expo where different countries will showcase their culture. The diversity at UC is one of the first things that come to mind when you think of its students, and these students should have a place to showcase their art, music, food and everything in between and share it with fellow Bearcats. 
        Day 2 - A reverse Career Fair where companies come and explain what they stand for, what their values are and give their elevator pitch as to why you should join them
        Day 3 - A concert on campus to elevate the spirit of music and fun amongst UC students. It will be a great way for students to rejuvenate and just celebrate college life as a whole. 
        Day 4 - A Fashion show/Pageant for students to showcase their skills and thoughts while walking the ramp to win the title of Ms. or Mr. UC.
